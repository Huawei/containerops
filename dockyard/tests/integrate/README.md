# What is this
This is the integration test by using dockyard client libs and client itself.
Each test file will talk to a server by Restful APIs.

## How to do integration test
### Setup the test
First, start a dockyard web server
```
$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/Huawei/dockyard
$ go build
$ // modify your containerops.conf or runtime.conf
$ ./dockyard web --port=1234 
```

### API test
Then you can run `go test`
```
$ export US_TEST_SERVER=http://localhost:1234
# cd $GOPATH/github.com/Huawei/dockyard
$ cd tests/integrate
$ go test
```


### Client test
Or you can run the `dc.sh` script, which is doing this:

```
$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/Huawei/dockyard
$ sh ./tests/integrate/dc.sh
```

The success output will be:
```
start to run test
push file appA
--------------------------------
push file appB
--------------------------------
list appA and appB
osA/archA/appA
osB/archB/appB
--------------------------------
pull appA
start to download file:  osA/archA/appA
Congratulations! The file is valid!
success in downloading and verifing file:  /root/.dockyard/cache/n/r/osA/archA/appA
--------------------------------
delete appA
--------------------------------
list appB only
osB/archB/appB
--------------------------------
pull appB
start to download file:  osB/archB/appB
Congratulations! The file is valid!
/root/.dockyard/cache/n/r/osB/archB/appB is encrypted, please using your private key to decrypt it. For security reason, we don't provide API to get private key, so if the private key is generated by server, contact system admin to get it!success in downloading and verifing file:  /root/.dockyard/cache/n/r/osB/archB/appB
--------------------------------
try to decrypt file, but the private key and appB file may not be in the right place
Success to decrypt /root/.dockyard/cache/n/r/osB/archB/appB to /root/.dockyard/cache/n/r/osB/archB/appB-decrypted

end of the test
--------------------------------
```
